# minigame_vision
A really poorly made automation tool for AnimeSoul minigames so you don't have to click.

After cloning this repo and running for the first time, you will need to replace the screenshots provided in the `static-captures` directory with your own screenshots. Alternatively you can tweak the confidence values in the script until it starts working.

SETUP:
python -m pip install requirements.txt
Before running the script login and navigate to https://animesoul.com/mini-games
